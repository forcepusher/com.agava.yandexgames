Make sure you have standalone [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed first.<br>
In Unity, open "Window" -> "Package Manager".<br>
Click the "+" sign on top left corner -> "Add package from git URL..."<br>
Paste this: `https://github.com/forcepusher/com.agava.yandexgames.git`<br>
If you need a usage sample, find it in the package window and click the "import" button.<br>
<br>
This package automatically inserts the SDK script into the HTML page and initializes itself. No need to mess with the WebGLTemplates - just use the SDK methods.<br>
