## [9.0.0] - 2022-07-22  
### Fixed  
- Interstitial misspelling.  
  
## [8.3.1] - 2022-06-08

- YandexGamesSdk.Environment data structure that proxies `ysdk.environment`.  
  
## [8.2.0] - 2022-02-27

## [8.1.0] - 2022-02-25

## [7.0.0] - 2021-12-24  
### Changed  
- WebBackgroundMute.Enable was replaced with WebApplication.InBackground property. Now you will have to manually set `AudioListener.pause = WebApplication.InBackground;` in an Update to achieve the same effect. Although now you can use it for anything rather than just muting the audio in the background.  
  
## [6.0.0] - 2021-12-15  
### Changed  
- PlayerAccount.Authorized is now PlayerAccount.IsAuthorized. Needed that to achieve full naming consistency across internal and external API.  
- Same goes for YandexGamesSdk.IsInitialized.  
  
## [5.0.1] - 2021-12-15  
### Fixed  
- Leaderboard.GetPlayerEntry successCallback silently stopping execution when it's supposed to return null.  
  
## [5.0.0] - 2021-12-14  
### Changed  
- Leaderboard.GetPlayerEntry now returns null in successCallback instead of invoking errorCallback.  
  
### Added  
- WebBackgroundMute to mute audio when RunInBackground is enabled.  
  
## [4.0.0] - 2021-12-13  
### Changed
